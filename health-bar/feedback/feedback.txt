Hi,

Currently, when I am using your amazing resource pack, my skin's set for default (Steve). If you could please look into it, I'd be thankful.

Best regards,

Hello, I'm currently using the win 10 version and for some reason creepers always appear as charged even if they aren't, it isnt a compatibility issue because that is he only addon i have and i literally just downloaded it again today to see if maybe i had an out of date version, if you need any other info i'll happily provide it

Yo! Amazing pack, tho one problem: creepers appear charged even when they aren't. Anyways I figured out a fix:
In render_controllers of entity/creeper.json 
replace 
"controller.render.creeper_armor", 
with
{"controller.render.creeper_armor": "query.is_powered"},

Hello I would like to report about a bug with normal ghasts  (doesn't happen with happy ghasts). it makes the ghast really big! I think it is really funny but it is sometimes annoying to understand if the ghast is close enough to shoot me. I really like this resource pack and I hope you fix it soon. best of luck!

W texture pack, however, in the new 1.21.92 update creeper's texture is fully charged about to blow up, and ghast is bigger than it should be. If its not possible to fix it, I would like to know that anyway.
